Rationale:

Disabling Remote Login mitigates the risk of an unauthorized person gaining access to the system via Secure Shell (SSH). While SSH is an industry standard to connect to posix servers, the scope of the benchmark is for Apple macOS clients, not servers.

macOS does have an IP based firewall available (pf, ipfw has been deprecated) that is not enabled or configured. There are more details and links in section 7.5. macOS no longer has TCP Wrappers support built-in and does not have strong Brute-Force password guessing mitigations, or frequent patching of openssh by Apple. Since most macOS computers are mobile workstations, managing IP-based firewall rules on mobile devices can be very resource-intensive. All of these factors can be parts of running a hardened SSH server.




Impact:

The SSH server built-in to macOS should not be enabled on a standard user computer, particularly one that changes locations and IP addresses. A standard user that runs local applications including email, web browser and productivity tools should not use the same device as a server. There are Enterprise management tool-sets that do utilize SSH. If they are in use, the computer should be locked down to only respond to known, trusted IP addresses and appropriate admin service accounts.

For macOS computers that are being used for specialized functions there are several options to harden the SSH server to protect against unauthorized access including brute force attacks. There are some basic criteria that need to be considered:

Do not open an SSH server to the internet without controls in place to mitigate SSH brute force attacks. This is particularly important for systems bound to Directory environments. It is great to have controls in place to protect the system, but if they trigger after the user is already locked out of their account they are not optimal. If authorization happens after authentication directory accounts for users that don't even use the system can be locked out.

Do not use SSH key pairs when there is no insight to the security on the client system that will authenticate into the server with a private key. If an attacker gets access to the remote system and can find the key they may not need a password or a key logger to access the SSH server.

Detailed instructions on hardening an SSH server, if needed, are available in the CIS Linux Benchmarks but it is beyond the scope of this benchmark."

By disabling file sharing, the remote attack surface and risk of unauthorized access to files stored on the system is reduced.

File Sharing can be used to share documents with other users but hardened servers should be used rather than user endpoints. Turning on file sharing increases the visibility and attack surface of a system unnecessarily."

      info        : "This feature allows the computer to take action when the user is not present and the computer is in energy saving mode. These tools require FileVault to remain unlocked and fully rejoin known networks. This macOS feature is meant to allow the computer to resume activity as needed regardless of physical security controls.

Power Nap allows the system to stay in low power mode, especially while on battery power and periodically connect to previously named networks with stored credentials for user applications to phone home and get updates. This capability requires FileVault to remain unlocked and the use of previously joined networks to be risk accepted based on the SSID without user input.

This control has been updated to check the status on both battery and AC Power. The presence of an electrical outlet does not completely correlate with logical and physical security of the device or available networks.

Rationale:

Disabling this feature mitigates the risk of an attacker remotely waking the system and gaining access.

The use of Power Nap adds to the risk of compromised physical and logical security. The user should be able to decrypt FileVault and have the applications download what is required when the computer is actively used.

The control to prevent computer sleep has been retired for this version of the Benchmark. Forcing the computer to stay on and use energy in case a management push is needed is contrary to most current management processes. Only keep computers unslept if after hours pushes are required on closed LANs.

Impact:

Power Nap exists for unattended user application updates like email and social media clients. With Power Nap disabled the computer will not wake and reconnect to known wireless SSIDs intermittently when slept."

While there are data spillage concerns with the use of data gathering personal assistant software, the risk here does not seem greater in sending queries to Apple through Siri than in sending search terms in a browser to Google or Microsoft. While it is possible that Siri will be used for local actions rather than Internet searches, Siri could, in theory, tell Apple about confidential Programs and Projects that should not be revealed. This appears be a usage edge case.

In cases where sensitive and protected data is processed and Siri could help a user navigate their machine and expose that information it should be disabled. Siri does need to phone home to Apple so it should not be available from air-gapped networks as part of its requirements.

Most of the use case data published has shown that Siri is a tremendous time saver on iOS where multiple screens and menus need to be navigated through. Information like sports scores, weather, movie times and simple to-do items on existing calendars can be easily found with Siri. None of the standard use cases should be more risky than already approved activity.

There are no known security issues with the use of Sidecar at the time of the publication of this Benchmark. There are security concerns with some of the underlying technology that allows this feature to work. The Apple support article below has the additional requirements that are reproduced below. So while Sidecar may not have an explicit security concern some organizations may have requirements that block the use of the features required to allow Sidecar to work.

https://support.apple.com/en-afri/HT210380

Additional requirements

Both devices must be signed in to iCloud with the same Apple ID using two-factor authentication.

To use Sidecar wirelessly, both devices must be within 10 meters (30 feet) of each other and have Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Handoff turned on. Also make sure that the iPad is not sharing its cellular connection and the Mac is not sharing its Internet connection.

To use Sidecar over USB, make sure that your iPad is set to trust your Mac.

Organizations that do not allow the use of iCloud and more specifically Handoff will not be able to use Sidecar.

Some organizations may not allow the use of mixed ownership for P2P wireless or USB connections so that unless the organization controls both the Mac and the iPad connections may not be approved and the use of a single Apple ID for distinctly managed devices may be prohibited.

Organizations need to have an understanding of integration of organizational and personal inventory in the work environment.

Another user on the same system can see you have a 'Documents' folder but cannot see inside it. This configuration does work for personal file sharing but can expose user files to standard accounts on the system.

The best parallel for Enterprise environments is that everyone who has a Dropbox account can see everything that is at the top level but can't see your pictures. Similarly with macOS, users can see into every new Directory that is created because of the default permissions.

Home folders should be restricted to access only by the user. Sharing should be used on dedicated servers or cloud instances that are managing access controls. Some environments may encounter problems if execute rights are removed as well as read and write. Either no access or execute only for group or others is acceptable.

Rationale:

Allowing all users to view the top level of all networked users' home folder may not be desirable since it may lead to the revelation of sensitive information.

Rationale:

The sudo command stays logged in as the root user for five minutes before timing out and re-requesting a password. This five-minute window should be eliminated since it leaves the system extremely vulnerable. This is especially true if an exploit were to gain access to the system, since they would be able to make changes as a root user.

Impact:

This control has a serious impact where users often have to use sudo. It is even more of an impact where users have to use sudo multiple times in quick succession as part of normal work processes. Organizations with that common use case will likely find this control too onerous and are better to accept the risk of not requiring a 0 grace period.

The benefit of not leaving the computer unlocked while the user is out of sight and readying the computer to resume work when the user returns without having to type in a password or insert a smartcard does seem attractive to people who have the Apple Watch. It is a continuation of other features like hand-off and continuity for the multiple Apple products users who have grown to expect their devices to work together.

For the screen unlock capability in particular, it may not be attractive to organizations that are managing Apple devices and credentials. The capability allows a user to unlock their computer tied to an Enterprise account with a personal token that is not managed or controlled by the Enterprise. If the user loses their watch revoking the credential that can unlock the screen might be problematic.

Apple Watches should not be used for screen unlocks, unless Enterprise control of the watch as a token tied to a user identity can be achieved. The risk of an auto-lock based on the user being out of proximity may still be acceptable if possible to do lock only.

This functionality does require the computer to be logged in to iCloud. If iCloud is disabled the Apple watch lock and unlock will not be possible.

A profile may be used to control unlock functionality.
