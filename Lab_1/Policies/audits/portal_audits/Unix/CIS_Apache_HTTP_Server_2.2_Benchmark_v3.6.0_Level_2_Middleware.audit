Rationale:

Using iframes and regular web frames to embed malicious content along with expected web content has been a favored attack vector for attacking web clients for a long time. This can happen when the attacker lures the victim to a malicious web site, which uses frames to include the expected content from the legitimate site. The attack can also be performed via XSS (either reflected, DOM or stored XSS) to add the malicious content to the legitimate web site. To combat this vector, an HTTP Response header, X-Frame-Options, has been introduced that allows a server to specify whether a web page may be loaded in any frame ('DENY') or only those frames that share the page's origin ('SAMEORIGIN')."

      info        : "The TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 protocols should be disabled via the 'SSLProtocol' directive. The TLSv1.0 protocol is vulnerable to information disclosure and both protocols lack support for modern cryptographic algorithms including authenticated encryption. The only SSL/TLS protocols that should be allowed is TLSv1.2 along with the new TLSv1.3 protocol when it is supported.

Rationale:

The TLSv1.0 protocol is vulnerable to the BEAST attack when used in CBC mode (October 2011). Unfortunately, the TLSv1.0 uses CBC modes for all of the block mode ciphers, which only leaves the RC4 streaming cipher which is also weak and is not recommended. Therefore, it is recommended that the TLSv1.0 protocol be disabled. The TLSv1.1 protocol does not support Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) which is designed to simultaneously provide confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. All major up-to-date browsers support TLSv1.2, and most recent versions of FireFox and Chrome support the newer TLSv1.3 protocol, since 2017.

The NIST SP 800-52r2 guidelines for TLS configuration require that TLS 1.2 is configured with FIPS-based cipher suites be supported by all government TLS servers and clients and requires support of TLS 1.3 by January 1, 2024. A September 2018 IETF draft also depreciates the usage of TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 as shown in the references."

1. Check if the TLSv1.3 protocol is supported by the Apache server by either checking that the version of OpenSSL is 1.1.1 or later or place the 'TLSv1.3' value in the 'SSLProtocol' string of a configuration file and check the syntax with the 'httpd -t' command before using the file in production. Two examples below are shown of servers that do support the TLSv1.3 protocol.

 $ openssl version
 OpenSSL 1.1.1a 20 Nov 2018

 ### _(Add TLSv1.3 to the SSLProtocol directive)_
 # httpd -t
 Syntax OK

2. Search the Apache configuration files for the 'SSLProtocol' directive; add the directive, if not present, or change the value to 'TLSv1.2' or 'TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3' if the TLSv1.3 protocol is supported."

      info        : "HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is an optional web server security policy mechanism specified by an HTTP Server header. The HSTS header allows a server declaration that only HTTPS communication should be used rather than clear text HTTP communication.

Rationale:

Usage of HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) helps protect HSTS-compliant browsers and other agents from HTTP downgrade attacks. Downgrade attacks include a variety of man-in-the-middle attacks which leave the web communication vulnerable to disclosure and modification by forcing the usage of HTTP rather than HTTPS communication. The 'sslstrip' attack tool by Moxie Marlinspike released in 2009 is one such attack, which works when a server allows both HTTP and HTTPS communication. However, a man-in-the-middle HTTP-to-HTTPS proxy would be effective in cases where the server required HTTPS but did not publish an HSTS policy to the browser. This attack would also be effective on browsers which were not compliant with HSTS. All current up-to-date browsers support HSTS.

The HSTS header specifies a length of time in seconds that the browser/user agent should access the server only using HTTPS. The header may also specify if all subdomains should also be included in the same policy. Once a compliant browser receives the HSTS header, it will not allow access to the server via HTTP. Therefore, it is important you ensure there is no portion of the web site or web application that requires HTTP prior to enabling the HSTS protocol.

If all subdomains are to be included via the _includeSubDomains_ option, carefully consider all various hostnames, web applications, and third-party services used to include any DNS CNAME values that may be impacted. An overly broad _includeSubDomains_ policy will disable access to HTTP websites for all websites with the same domain name. Also consider that the access will be disabled for the number of seconds given in the max-age value, so in the event a mistake is made, a large value, such as a year, could create significant support issues.

      description : "7.12 Ensure Only Cipher Suites That Provide Forward Secrecy Are Enabled"
      info        : "In cryptography, _forward secrecy_ (FS), which is also known as _perfect forward secrecy_ (PFS), is a feature of specific key exchange protocols that give assurance that your session keys will not be compromised even if the private key of the server is compromised. Protocols such as RSA do not provide the forward secrecy, while the protocols 'ECDHE' (Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral) and the 'DHE' (Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral) will provide forward secrecy. The 'ECDHE' is the stronger protocol and should be preferred, while the 'DHE' may be allowed for greater compatibility with older clients. The TLS ciphers should be configured to require either the 'ECDHE' or the 'DHE' ephemeral key exchange, while not allowing other cipher suites.

Rationale:

During the TLS handshake, after the initial client & server Hello, there is a pre-master secret generated, which is used to generate the master secret, and in turn generates the session key. When using protocols that do not provide forward secrecy, such as RSA, the pre-master secret is encrypted by the client with the server's public key and sent over the network.

Access is controlled by process types (domains) defined for the httpd process. There are over a hundred individual httpd related types defined in a default Apache SELinux policy, which includes many of the common Apache add-ons and applications such as php, nagios, and smokeping. The default SELinux policies work well for a default Apache installation, but implementation of SELinux targeted policies on a complex or highly customized web server requires a rather significant development and testing effort which comprehends both the workings of SELinux and the detailed operations and requirements of the web application.

All directories and files to be accessed by the web server process must have security labels with appropriate types. The following types are a sample of the most commonly used:
- 'http_port_t' - Network ports allowed for listening
- 'httpd_sys_content_t' - Read access to directories and files with web content
- 'httpd_log_t' - Directories and files to be used for writable log data
- 'httpd_sys_script_exec_t' - Directories and files for executable content.

Rationale:

With the proper implementation of SELinux, vulnerabilities in the web application may be prevented from being exploited due to the additional restrictions. For example, a vulnerability that allows an attacker to read inappropriate system files may be prevented from execution by SELinux because the inappropriate files are not labeled as 'httpd_sys_content_t'. Likewise, writing to an unexpected directory or execution of unexpected content can be prevented by similar mandatory security labels enforced by SELinux."
          solution    : "Perform the following to implement the recommended state:

If the running httpd processes are not confined to the 'httpd_t' SELinux context, check the context for the httpd binary and the 'apachectl' binary, and set the httpd binary to have a context of 'httpd_exec_t' and the 'apachectl' executable to have a context of 'initrc_exec_t', as shown below. Also note that on some platforms, such as Ubuntu, the Apache executable is named apache2 instead of httpd.

# ls -alZ /usr/sbin/httpd /usr/sbin/httpd.* /usr/sbin/apachectl
-rwxr-xr-x. root root system_u:object_r:initrc_exec_t:s0 /usr/sbin/apachectl
-rwxr-xr-x. root root system_u:object_r:httpd_exec_t:s0 /usr/sbin/httpd
-rwxr-xr-x. root root system_u:object_r:httpd_exec_t:s0 /usr/sbin/httpd.worker
-rwxr-xr-x. root root system_u:object_r:httpd_exec_t:s0 /usr/sbin/httpd.event

If the executable files are not labeled correctly, they may be relabeled with the 'chcon' command, as shown; however, the file system labeling is based on the SELinux file context policies, and the file systems will on some occasions be relabeled according to the policy.

# chcon -t initrc_exec_t /usr/sbin/apachectl
# chcon -t httpd_exec_t /usr/sbin/httpd /usr/sbin/httpd.*

Since the file system may be relabeled based on SELinux policy, it's best to check the SELinux policy with the 'semanage fcontext -l' option. If the policy is not present, add the pattern to the policy using the '-a' option. The 'restorecon' command shown below will restore the file context label according to the current policy, and is required if a pattern was added.

# ### Check the Policy
# semanage fcontext -l | fgrep 'apachectl'
# /usr/sbin/apachectl regular file system_u:object_r:initrc_exec_t:s0

          info        : "SELinux includes customizable targeted policies that may be used to confine the Apache httpd server to enforce least privileges so the httpd server has only the minimal access to specified directories, files, and network ports. Access is controlled by process types (domains) defined for the httpd process. There are over a hundred individual httpd related types defined in a default Apache SELinux policy, which includes many of the common Apache add-ons and applications such as php, nagios, and smokeping. The default SELinux policies work well for a default Apache installation, but implementation of SELinux targeted policies on a complex or highly customized web server requires a rather significant development and testing effort which comprehends both the workings of SELinux and the detailed operations and requirements of the web application.

All directories and files to be accessed by the web server process must have security labels with appropriate types. The following types are a sample of the most commonly used:
- 'http_port_t' - Network ports allowed for listening
- 'httpd_sys_content_t' - Read access to directories and files with web content
- 'httpd_log_t' - Directories and files to be used for writable log data
- 'httpd_sys_script_exec_t' - Directories and files for executable content.

Rationale:

With the proper implementation of SELinux, vulnerabilities in the web application may be prevented from being exploited due to the additional restrictions. For example, a vulnerability that allows an attacker to read inappropriate system files may be prevented from execution by SELinux because the inappropriate files are not labeled as 'httpd_sys_content_t'. Likewise, writing to an unexpected directory or execution of unexpected content can be prevented by similar mandatory security labels enforced by SELinux."
          solution    : "Perform the following to implement the recommended state:

If the running httpd processes are not confined to the 'httpd_t' SELinux context, check the context for the httpd binary and the 'apachectl' binary, and set the httpd binary to have a context of 'httpd_exec_t' and the 'apachectl' executable to have a context of 'initrc_exec_t', as shown below. Also note that on some platforms, such as Ubuntu, the Apache executable is named apache2 instead of httpd.

# ls -alZ /usr/sbin/httpd /usr/sbin/httpd.* /usr/sbin/apachectl
-rwxr-xr-x. root root system_u:object_r:initrc_exec_t:s0 /usr/sbin/apachectl
-rwxr-xr-x. root root system_u:object_r:httpd_exec_t:s0 /usr/sbin/httpd
-rwxr-xr-x. root root system_u:object_r:httpd_exec_t:s0 /usr/sbin/httpd.worker
-rwxr-xr-x. root root system_u:object_r:httpd_exec_t:s0 /usr/sbin/httpd.event

If the executable files are not labeled correctly, they may be relabeled with the 'chcon' command, as shown; however, the file system labeling is based on the SELinux file context policies, and the file systems will on some occasions be relabeled according to the policy.

# chcon -t initrc_exec_t /usr/sbin/apachectl
# chcon -t httpd_exec_t /usr/sbin/httpd /usr/sbin/httpd.*

Since the file system may be relabeled based on SELinux policy, it's best to check the SELinux policy with the 'semanage fcontext -l' option. If the policy is not present, add the pattern to the policy using the '-a' option. The 'restorecon' command shown below will restore the file context label according to the current policy, and is required if a pattern was added.

# ### Check the Policy
# semanage fcontext -l | fgrep 'apachectl'
# /usr/sbin/apachectl regular file system_u:object_r:initrc_exec_t:s0
# semanage fcontext -l | fgrep '/usr/sbin/httpd'
# /usr/sbin/httpd regular file system_u:object_r:httpd_exec_t:s0
# /usr/sbin/httpd.worker regular file system_u:object_r:httpd_exec_t:s0
# /usr/sbin/httpd.event regular file system_u:object_r:httpd_exec_t:s0
# ### Add to the policy, if not present
# semanage fcontext -f -- -a -t httpd_exec_t '/usr/sbin/httpd'
# semanage fcontext -f -- -a -t httpd_exec_t '/usr/sbin/httpd.worker'
# semanage fcontext -f -- -a -t httpd_exec_t '/usr/sbin/httpd.event'

          info        : "AppArmor profiles may be in one of three modes: disabled, complain, or enforce. In the complain mode, any violations of the access controls are logged but the restrictions are not enforced. Also, once a profile mode has been changed, it is recommended to restart the Apache server, otherwise the currently running process may not be confined by the policy.

Rationale:

The complain mode is useful for testing and debugging a profile but is not appropriate for production. Only the confined process running in enforce mode will prevent attacks that violate the configured access controls."
          solution    : "Perform the following to implement the recommended state:

1. Set the profile state to enforce mode.

 # aa-enforce apache2
 Setting /usr/sbin/apache2 to enforce mode.

2. Stop the Apache server and confirm that is it not running. In some cases, the AppArmor controls may prevent the web server from stopping properly, and it may be necessary to stop the process manually or even reboot the server.

 # service apache2 stop
 * Stopping web server apache2
 # service apache2 status
 * apache2 is not running

3. Restart the Apache service.

 # service apache2 start
 * Starting web server apache2"
