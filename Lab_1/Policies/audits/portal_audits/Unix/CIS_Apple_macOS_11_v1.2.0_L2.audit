      description : "1.7 Computer Name Considerations."
      info        : "If the computer is used in an organization that assigns host names, it is a good idea to change the computer name to the host name. This is more of a best practice than a security measure. If the host name and the computer name are the same, computer support may be able to track problems down more easily.

Standard naming patterns avoid collisions and mitigate risk for computer users.

With mobile devices using DHCP IP tracking has serious drawbacks; hostname or computer name tracking makes much more sense for those organizations that can implement it. If the computer is using different names for the 'Computer Name' DNS and Directory environments it can be difficult to manage Macs in an Enterprise asset inventory.

Rationale:

Part of IT security is having visibility into all of the devices that the organization is responsible for. Without a complete inventory it is impossible to ensure all security controls are met on all organizational devices.

Default macOS naming deconfliction controls can create issues for appropriate management and tracking as well as privacy exposure. By default the name of a macOS computer is derived from the first user created. If the user has multiple computers or an image is used without an appropriate name change there will be multiple computers with names derived from the same user for discovery deconfliction. How many 'Ron Colvin's MacBook Pro' should there be, are any missing?

Local network auto renaming to avoid collisions also allows for the enumeration of local computer names. Computers should not be named after their users, especially on untrusted networks. For social engineering purposes the computer name should not provide a full name of the user or an identifiable name that might be used to assist in targeted user attacks.

A documented plan to better enable a complete device inventory without exposing user or organizational information is part of mature security.

      info         : "Starting with 10.13 (macOS High Sierra) Apple introduced a service to make it easier to deploy data from Apple, including software updates, where there are bandwidth constraints to the Internet and fewer constraints and greater bandwidth on the local subnet. This capability can be very valuable for organizations that have throttled and possibly metered Internet connections. In heterogeneous enterprise networks with multiple subnets the effectiveness of this capability would be determined on how many Macs were on each subnet at the time new large updates were made available upstream. This capability requires the use of mac OS clients as P2P nodes for updated Apple content. Unless there is a business requirement to manage operational Internet connectivity bandwidth user endpoints should not store content and act as a cluster to provision data.

Content types supported by Content Caching in macOS

Rationale:

The main use case for Mac computers is as mobile user endpoints. P2P sharing services should not be enabled on laptops that are using untrusted networks. Content Caching can allow a computer to be a server for local nodes on an untrusted network. While there are certainly logical controls that could be used to mitigate risk, they add to the management complexity. Since the value of the service is in specific use cases organizations with the use case described above can accept risk as necessary.

Impact:

This setting will adversely affect bandwidth usage between local subnets and the Internet."

This allows a user to share downloaded Movies, Music or TV shows with other controlled macOS, iOS and iPadOS devices as well as photos with Apple TVs.

With this capability guest users can also use media downloaded on the computer.

The recommended best practice is not to use the computer as a server but to utilize Apple's cloud storage to download and use content stored there if content stored with Apple is used on multiple devices.

Depending on workplace requirements it may not be appropriate to intermingle Enterprise and personal bookmarks, photos and documents. Since the service allows every device associated with the user's ID to synchronize and have access to the cloud storage the concern is not just about having sensitive data on Apple's servers but having that same data on the phone of the teenage son or daughter of an employee. The use of family sharing options can reduce the risk.

Apple's iCloud is just one of many cloud-based solutions being used for data synchronization across multiple platforms and it should be controlled consistently with other cloud services in your environment. Work with your employees and configure the access to best enable data protection for your mission.

Rationale:

Organizations must make a risk decision on how their computers will interact with public cloud services.

Impact:

iCloud services are integrated deeply into macOS and in many cases are expected to be used by Mac users. iCloud is a public cloud and is not covered by an organizational security plan. In many cases synchronizing user data from an organizational computer to an uncontrolled location, no matter who is the data owner, is unacceptable.

      description : "3.7 Software Inventory Considerations"
      info        : "With the introduction of Mac OS X 10.6.6, Apple added a new application, App Store, which resides in the Applications directory. This application allows a user with admin privileges and an Apple ID to browse Apple's online App Store, purchase (including no cost purchases), and install new applications, bypassing Enterprise software inventory controls. Any admin user can install software in the /Applications directory whether from internet downloads, thumb drives, optical media, cloud storage or even binaries through email. Even standard users can run executables downloaded to their home folder by default. The source of the software is not nearly as important as a consistent audit of all installed software for patch compliance and appropriateness.

A single user desktop where the user, administrator and the person approving software are all the same person probably does not need to audit software inventory to this extent. It is helpful in the case of stability problems or malware however.

Scan systems on a monthly basis and determine the number of unauthorized pieces of software that are installed. Verify that if an unauthorized piece of software is found one month, it is removed from the system the next.

Export System Information through the built-in System Information Application or other third-party tools on an organizationally defined timetable.

Rationale:

Part of comprehensive IT security involves device management and ensuring that all software is authorized and patched. Checking for macOS updates and app updates are relatively simple for the end user and can even be updated with minimal privileges from trusted sources if enabled. Remote monitoring of the patch status for software maintained through Apple is very well supported by management applications. Neither Apple capabilities nor third-party patch management solutions will cover all mission necessary software for most organizations. Full visibility into software present on the system enables vulnerability and risk management.

PS Don't forget about browser plugins/extensions for all installed software.

Rationale:

Bonjour can simplify device discovery from an internal rogue or compromised host. An attacker could use Bonjour's multicast DNS feature to discover a vulnerable or poorly-configured service or additional information to aid a targeted attack. Implementing this control disables the continuous broadcasting of 'I'm here!' messages. Typical end-user endpoints should not have to advertise services to other computers. This setting does not stop the computer from sending out service discovery messages when looking for services on an internal subnet, if the computer is looking for a printer or server and using service discovery. To block all Bonjour traffic except to approved devices the pf or other firewall would be needed.

Impact:

Some applications, like Final Cut Studio and AirPort Base Station management, may not operate properly if the mDNSResponder is turned off."

The approach recommended here is that the login keychain be set to lock when the computer sleeps to reduce the risk of password exposure. Organizations that use Firefox and Thunderbird will have a much different tolerance than those organizations using keychain aware applications extensively.

Rationale:

While logged in, the keychain does not prompt the user for passwords for various systems and/or programs. This can be exploited by unauthorized users to gain access to password-protected programs and/or systems in the absence of the user.

Impact:

The user may experience multiple prompts to unlock the keychain when waking from sleep."
      solution    : "Perform the following to set the login keychain to lock on sleep:
Graphical Method:

Open Keychain Access

Select the login keychain

Select Edit

Select Change Settings for keychain login

Set Lock when sleeping

Terminal Method:
For each user, run the following command to set the login keychain to sleep on lock:

$ sudo -u <username> security  set-keychain-settings -l /Users/<username>/Library/Keychains/login.keychain

$ sudo -u firstuser security set-keychain-settings -l /Users/firstuser/Library/Keychains/login.keychain"

Mac systems should be set to hibernate after sleeping for a risk-acceptable time period. The default value for 'standbydelay' is three hours (10800 seconds). This value is likely appropriate for most desktops. If Mac desktops are deployed in unmonitored, less physically secure areas with confidential data this value might be adjusted. The desktop or would have to retain power so that the running OS or physical RAM could be attacked however.




MacBooks should be set so that the standbydelay is 15 minutes (900 seconds) or less. This setting should allow laptop users in most cases to stay within physically secured areas while going to a conference room, auditorium or other internal location without having to unlock the encryption. When the user goes home at night the laptop will auto-hibernate after 15 minutes and require the FileVault password to unlock prior to logging back into system when it resumes.

MacBooks should also be set to a hibernate mode that removes power from the RAM. This will stop the possibility of cold boot attacks on the system.

Rationale:

To mitigate the risk of data loss the system should power down and lock the encrypted drive after a specified time. Laptops should hibernate 15 minutes or less after sleeping.

Impact:

The laptop will take additional time to resume normal operation then if only sleeping rather than hibernating."

Mac systems should be set to hibernate after sleeping for a risk-acceptable time period. The default value for 'standbydelay' is three hours (10800 seconds). This value is likely appropriate for most desktops. If Mac desktops are deployed in unmonitored, less physically secure areas with confidential data this value might be adjusted. The desktop or would have to retain power so that the running OS or physical RAM could be attacked however.




MacBooks should be set so that the standbydelay is 15 minutes (900 seconds) or less. This setting should allow laptop users in most cases to stay within physically secured areas while going to a conference room, auditorium or other internal location without having to unlock the encryption. When the user goes home at night the laptop will auto-hibernate after 15 minutes and require the FileVault password to unlock prior to logging back into system when it resumes.

MacBooks should also be set to a hibernate mode that removes power from the RAM. This will stop the possibility of cold boot attacks on the system.

Rationale:

To mitigate the risk of data loss the system should power down and lock the encrypted drive after a specified time. Laptops should hibernate 15 minutes or less after sleeping.

Impact:

The laptop will take additional time to resume normal operation then if only sleeping rather than hibernating."

Each keychain entry can have different access controls. It's possible to set the keychain item to require a keychain password every time an item is accessed, even if the keychain is unlocked. This level of security could be useful for bank passwords or other passwords that need extra security.

      info        : "EFI is the software link between the motherboard hardware and the software operating system. EFI determines which partition or disk to load macOS from, it also determines whether the user can enter single-user mode. The main reasons to set a firmware password have been protections against an alternative boot disk, protection against a passwordless root shell through single user mode and protection against firewire DMA attacks. In the past it was not difficult to reset the firmware password by removing RAM but it did make tampering slightly harder and having to remove RAM remediated memory scraping attacks through DMA. It has always been difficult to Manage the firmware password on macOS computers, though some tools did make it much easier.

Apple patched OS X in 10.7 to mitigate the DMA attacks and the use of FileVault 2 Full-Disk Encryption mitigates the risk of damage to the boot volume if an unauthorized user uses a different boot volume or uses Single User Mode. Apple's reliance on the recovery partition and the additional features it provides make controls that do not allow the user to boot into the recovery partition less attractive.

Starting in Late 2010 with the MacBook Air Apple has slowly updated the requirements to recover from a lost firmware password. Apple only supports taking the computer to an Apple authorized service provider. This change makes managing the firmware password effectively more critical if it is used.

Setting the firmware password may be good practice in some environments. We cannot recommend it as a standard security practice at this time.

These distinct services have been more cleanly integrated starting in 10.12.

This integrated service for password and decryption is a concern in Enterprise environments. Normal Enterprise management controls mitigate the risk of external control of organizational systems. The user of the system already has the ability to unlock the disk in order to log in and use it and some form of password recovery function is likely already in place for any approved accounts. In addition:

You cannot reset anything but a local account

You need physical access to the computer on a network that can phone home to Apple

Enterprise FileVault management precludes the use of Apple's personal encryption recovery tied to a User's Apple ID

The current login keychain will have to be discarded unless the user remembers the old password

This service allows for organizational computer users to utilize AppleIDs for encryption key escrow and user account management. The use of Apple's services rather than Enterprise services may be considered inappropriate.

      info        : "It is best practice to ensure that local computers are not a single point of failure for logging and auditing records about activity on the computer itself. Whether end user activity or system process information a mechanism should be in place to transfer the logs to another system that is hardened to receive them. A hardened log host reduces the risk of failure or compromise, particularly with user end points. From an enterprise management standpoint those records should be reviewed to ensure that there is not a common exploitable vulnerability, system bug or even hardware issue that can affect other devices in the environment.

With changes in Apple's logging methods in the last few years third party tools appear to be preferred to ensure logs and records are obtained appropriately. Aggressive retention likely requires more space than available on built-in SSDs even if offline Time Machine backups are large and pristine.

Please ensure that solutions to capture and retain log and audit records are in place.
